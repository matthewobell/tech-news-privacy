# Privacy Policy for Tech News App

**Last Updated: June 4, 2025**

## Overview
Tech News App is a simple RSS news reader that prioritizes your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information in our app.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Specifically, we do not collect:
- Personal information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Location data
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports
- Device identifiers
- Browsing history
- Account information

## How the App Works
- **RSS Feeds**: The app downloads public RSS feeds directly from news sources
- **Local Storage**: Article preferences (bookmarks, read status) are stored locally on your device only
- **No Servers**: We do not operate any servers or databases that store your information
- **No Accounts**: No user accounts or sign-ups required

## Third-Party Content
The app displays content from various news sources via their public RSS feeds. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these news sources. When you tap to read a full article, you'll be taken to the original publisher's website, which may have its own privacy policy.

## Data Security
Since we don't collect data, there's no personal data to be compromised. All app preferences are stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms.

## Children's Privacy
Our app does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
